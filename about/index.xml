I’m Sig, and I’m excited to welcome you to my blog. I love exploring the intersection of technology and the environment. My journey began with a degree in Geography, which ignited my interest in how we can use spatial data to solve real-world problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the privilege of working with diverse teams across various sectors, including local government, tech, and real estate. I believe in the power of data to inform decision-making and drive positive change.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
