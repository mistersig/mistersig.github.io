As a Geospatial developer who is developing my own geocomputation course, I often reflect upon geocomputing’s origins. This interdisciplinary specialization combines geospatial science and computer science and the benefits to improve efficiencies and tackle complex problems in geospatial topics in academy and industry are numerous.
While geography as a discipline has a history spanning over 2,000 years going back to ancient civilizations, most notably Eratosthenes in ancient Greece, GIS has its roots in the 1960s when Roger Tomlinson created the first Geographic Information System for the Canadian government. This marked what we now recognize as the start of the computer revolution, integrating computers into the discipline of geography and mapping our physical world. GIS has since been embraced as a standalone discipline and has also been adopted by several other disciplines and industries to solve spatial problems and build more sophisticated geographical analyses and models.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>File Paths Windows</title><link>https://mistersig.github.io/posts/file-paths-windows/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 20:59:42 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://mistersig.github.io/posts/file-paths-windows/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="understanding-file-paths-in-windows">Understanding File Paths in Windows&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="basic-components-of-a-file-path">Basic Components of a File Path&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A Windows file path consists of three primary components:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Volume/Drive Letter&lt;/strong>: Typically represented by a letter followed by a colon (e.g., &lt;code>C:&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Directory Structure&lt;/strong>: Directories separated by backslashes &lt;code>\&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Filename&lt;/strong>: The specific file at the end of the path&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="path-types">Path Types&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>An absolute path provides the complete location of a file from the root of a drive.

&lt;h3 id="why-start-this-blog">Why Start This Blog?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After years of working in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and software development, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that knowledge is most powerful when shared. This blog represents my commitment to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Documenting My Learning Journey&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Capture complex technical processes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a personal knowledge repository&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Help other developers navigate similar challenges&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Contribute to the GIS Community&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Share practical development tricks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide in-depth technical guides&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Demystify complex geospatial workflows&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
